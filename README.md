# Whitelist Dapp built with Motoko.


## How the dapp works.
This is a simple whitelist dapp that enables users to request for a whitelist spot from a project. 

The dapp has three entities. The `owner`, `users` and `admins`.

The owner has all the admin priviledges. 

A user can:
* Send in a request to be whitelisted
* Check the status of their request

An admin can:
* Add and delete other admins
* Grant and revoke whitelist spots to the users
* View a list of all whitelsited users
* View a list of all admins 
* View a list of all users requesting to be whitelisted
